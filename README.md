# KVectors
This is a pure Python 3.x implementation of 3d Vector mathematics at a Calculus 3 level.
(Sympy is pure Python, so that doesn't count, right? ;)

Implemented classes include Point3d, Vector3d, Plane3d, and VectorValueFunction3d.

# Dependencies
Sympy and Python 3.6

To install sympy, enter "pip install sympy" into a command line.

# Planned features:
- Vector3d.parallel(Vector3d) function to see if the vectors are parallel.
- Vector3d.perpendicular(Vector3d) function to see if the vectors are perpendicular.
- Greater/Less Than magic methods to directly compare vector magnitudes.
