# KVectors
This is a pure Python 3.x implementation of 3d Vector mathematics at a Calculus 3 level.

# Dependencies
None, just Python 3.x :)

# Planned features:
- Vector3d.parallel(Vector3d) function to see if the vectors are parallel.
- Vector3d.perpendicular(Vector3d) function to see if the vectors are perpendicular.
- Greater/Less Than magic methods to directly compare vector magnitudes.
